# Principal-Component-Analysis-PCA-
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a technique used for dimensionality reduction and data visualization. It works by transforming the data into a new coordinate system where the axes are the directions of maximum variance in the data. The first principal component captures the most variance, the second captures the second most, and so on.

Steps in PCA:

1. Standardize the Data
2. Calculate Covariance Matrix
3. Calculate Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
4.  Select Principal Components.
5. Project Data onto Principal Components.
6. Transform original data using selected eigenvectors for dimensionality reduction.
7. Interpret Results:

#### Advantages of PCA:
1. Dimensionality Reduction
2. Removal of Redundancy
3. Visualizing Complex Data
4. Improving Model Performance
5. Speeding Up Computation


#### Disadvantages of PCA:
1. Loss of Interpretability
2. Sensitive to Scaling
3. Non-linear Relationships
4. May Not Capture Outliers or Noise
6. Requires Orthogonality
7. Limited to Linear Transformations
